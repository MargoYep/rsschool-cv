## About me
I`m 2D animator. I work in TheSoul Publishing. I decided to change the field of work, the choice fell on a front-end developer, because at the university I received a minimum knowledge base in this area, but did not go further into IT. I want to be a developer and work in this area, because I like it, plus it's interesting to study.
1. I have basic HTML, CSS skills.
2. I don`t have examples
3. I don`t have experience
4. Bachelor's degree: Applied Informatics
5. English level Pre-Intermediate
6. [Github project](https://github.com/MargoYep/rsschool-cv.git)

## Code example
```
function multiply(a, b){
  a * b
}
```
